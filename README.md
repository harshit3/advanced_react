# advanced_react
I have built this full stack express/react application without using any boiler plate.
Webpack as application bundler.
Babel for tranpiling ES6 to ES5.
EJS for Express Views.

Steps to run in devlopment mode- 
1)npm run webpack (bundle.js will be created in public/bundle.js)
2)npm start
